# TODO

- Indicate on the BoardView:
  + the different zones (_e.g_ thicken the borders)
  + the initial zones (_e.g._ use the player's color for the border)
  + maybe the opponent zones (_e.g._ a tooltip stating the name of the player who must fill this zone)
  + the name of the player around its initial zones
  + which pawn is on each occupied square (_e.g._ fill the square with the owner's color)
